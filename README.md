## Hi, I'm Bukky
(●'◡'●) I'm an aspiring full-stack developer.

💻 Currently learnig react 😭, with future plans to become a full MERN stack dev , also learning some web animations like GSAP and anything to advance my path in web development(fingers crossed 🤞).

🔧 I'm currently studying computer science.

🌱 Always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

🎮 When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, watching anime, or geeking out over the latest in tech.

📫 Let's connect! Feel free to reach out or contribute to any of my projects(when i finally have projects😭). Together, we can build something amazing (ง •_•)ง!
